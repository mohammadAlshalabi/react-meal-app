    1. Install the dependencies by running npm install
    2. Start the app by running npm start
	3. Track your needed time to complete this assessment
    4. Test the app manually to identify any possible bugs. You should thoroughly test each feature and functionality of the application.
	Document any bugs you find with clear steps to reproduce them.
	
    5. Create an automated test suite that tests all the functions of the app. 
	You should use Cypress and include tests for all the major features of the app. 
	Your tests should be well-organized, clearly documented, and provide detailed output in case of failures.

Evaluation Criteria:

    Your manual testing approach: We will evaluate the thoroughness of your manual testing and the clarity of your bug reports. 
	We will also assess your ability to identify edge cases and potential issues that might arise from real-world use of the app.

    Your automated test suite: We will evaluate the completeness of your test suite and the quality of your test cases. 

Good luck!
